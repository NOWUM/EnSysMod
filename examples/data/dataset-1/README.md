# Example dataset
This test dataset is a multi regional example based on data provided in 
[FINE Multi-regional_Energy_System_Workflow example](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE/tree/master/examples/Multi-regional_Energy_System_Workflow/InputData/SpatialData).

It contains the following data:
- 8 regions
- 5 commodities
- 6 energy conversion plants
- 3 energy sinks
- 6 energy sources
- 4 energy storages
- 4 transmission lines

The commodities cover electricity (in GW), hydrogen (in GW), methane (in GW), biogas (in GW) and CO2 (in million t CO2/h). This can be read in the commodities.json.

To use this example and optimize the energy system which is modeled in this, you need to acced the tool. How to create and optimize a datasets is explained [here](https://nowum.github.io/EnSysMod/usage.html).
