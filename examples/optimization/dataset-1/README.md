# Example optimization
This test optimization is the output of the optimization of the dataset-1 in the folder data.

The resulting excel file has 13 spreadsheets: 
- SourceSinkOptSummary_1dim
- SourceSink_TDoptVar_1dim
- SourceSink_TIoptVar_1dim
- ConversionOptSummary_1dim
- Conversion_TDoptVar_1dim
- Conversion_TIoptVar_1dim
- StorageOptSummary_1dim
- Storage_TDoptVar_1dim
- Storage_TIoptVar_1dim
- TransmissionOptSummary_1dim
- Transmission_TDoptVar_1dim
- Transmission_TIoptVar_1dim
- Misc

Always three spreadsheets are for one energy component (source & sink together, conversion, transmisison, storage) plus one extra for miscellaneous.

How to interpret the contents of the spreadsheets is described [here](https://nowum.github.io/EnSysMod/usage/output.html),
