This chapter describes how to use the EnSysMod tool.

This tool allows you to create a new EnSysMod model and optimize it for lowest costs.

In order to run multiple simulations for one dataset the tool is divided into two parts:

    1. The **dataset** allows you to create an abstract model for your scenario.
    2. The **model** allows you to prepare and optimize based on a dataset with individual simulation parameters.

On the following pages you will find more detailed information about the different parts of the tool and how to use
them. Click on **next** to continue.
