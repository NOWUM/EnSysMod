How to use EnSysMod
*******************

The EnSysMod tool provides an easy to access REST api for all functions.
All endpoints can be seen and consumed with the **/docs** or **/redoc** endpoint of the server.

Currently there is no visual frontend by now.

Online version
==============
If you want to use the EnSysMod tool, you can simply do so by accessing the deployed version inside the FH Aachen
virtual private network.

In order to access the FH Aachen VPN,
see `this guide <https://www.fh-aachen.de/hochschule/datenverarbeitungszentrale/netzanbindung/vpn>`_.

Access the `development <http://10.13.10.51:9000/docs>`_
or the `production <http://10.13.10.51:8080/docs>`_ deployment.
All active deployments can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/NOWUM/EnSysMod/deployments>`_.


Local installation
==================
If you do not want to use the online version of EnSysMod, you can run it on your local maschine.

    - Download the ready-to-use docker container.
    - Download the source code from GitHub.

Both ways are described in the `installation instructions on Github <https://github.com/NOWUM/EnSysMod#installation>`_.
